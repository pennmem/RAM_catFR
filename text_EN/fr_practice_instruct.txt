In this study, we would like to see how well you recall lists of random words.  In between lists, you will be given the task of solving math problems in the form "A+B+C=", where A, B, and C are integers.

When you see a math problem, please type in the answer using the keypad and then press the ENTER key.  You can use the BACKSPACE key if you make a mistake.

You will now have a chance to practice the math task.  Consider this practice session as an opportunity to build up speed without sacrificing accuracy.

Please let the research assistant know when you have finished reading these instructions.
