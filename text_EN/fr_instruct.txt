In this study, words will appear on the computer screen.  As each word is shown make a picture in your mind of what the word refers to. Please refrain from saying the word out-loud. Do not try to think back to other words in the list. Also, try not to blink or move around during word presentations.

After the last word in each list, you will be shown several math problems. Answer them as quickly and accurately as you can. When you have completed these math problems, you will see a row of asterisks (*******) flash on the screen and you will hear a tone.  At this time, say as many words as you can remember from the list, IN ANY ORDER.  Speak loudly and clearly. You will have a fixed amount of time in which to recall the list. Please try hard throughout the recall period, as you may recall some words even when you feel you have exhausted your memory.
